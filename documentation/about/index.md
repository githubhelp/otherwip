Emonhub was previously known as the OEM gateway and originally written by Jérôme Lafréchoux. 

It has been used by the OpenEnergyMonitor project for sometime, mainly but not exclusively as a standalone data forwarding solution, It became better known as the "Rock-solid Gateway" as when installed on a read-only sdcard it offered a simple and very reliable alternative to a self hosted emonCMS server, faithfully forwarding data to emoncms.org.
