### EmonHub *(erstwhile oem-gateway)*

EmonHub is the excellent OEM gateway revised, repackaged and relaunched. Although the oem gateway has been about for sometime it has not been fully adopted or utilized. 

### *emonHub connects your inputs with emonCMS*

Currently the OpenEnergyMonitor project's most popular emonBase option is the Raspberry Pi, usually used either as a standalone forwarder running the OEM gateway or as a full emonCMS server installation using either the python or php input scripts. 

The emonHub software aims to unify these approaches into one multipurpose software that can run independently as a forwarder or on the same machine as a part of a full emonCMS installation.
