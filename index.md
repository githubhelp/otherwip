### *emonHub connects your inputs with emonCMS*

Currently the OpenEnergyMonitor project's most popular emonBase option is the Raspberry Pi, usually used either as a standalone forwarder running the OEM gateway or as a full emonCMS server installation using either the python or php input scripts. The emonHub software was designed to unify these approaches into one multipurpose software that can run independantly as a forwarder or on the same machine as a part of a full emonCMS installation.
